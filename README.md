## About
-- A messaging site that pulls from 5 different APIs to allow users to ask questions about 30 different categories of basketball statistics. I trained an AI API to figure out the meaning of a user's question. The messenger can also understand context. Additionally, I implemented text to speech, so users can ask questions by voice.
